Fallback Messenger
========

The smart multi-protocol IM and SMS client for Ubuntu Touch

At it's core, Fallback will be a multi-protocol IM client (like pidgin), but Fallback takes it a step further.  Instead of sending a message to Jon's gmail or Jon's facebook or Jon's phone number.  You will just send a message to Jon, and the app will figure out which service to use based on where Jon is online, which service was used to talk to you last, and how recently that was.
